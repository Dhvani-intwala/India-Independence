## Design
### **Colour Scheme**

This website uses a palette of colours with shades pulled from white,Orange and black. These embody I wanted to create for the site because it looks pleasing to the eyes. The palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to source the font styles used throughout the website :
- cursive : section headings
- sans-serif : used for main body text and logo 

These fonts were chosen to keep the website style as clean and simple. They were also chosen to ensure maximum accessibility.

### **Accessibility**

For the Best user experience having an accessible website is most important. Therefore, I have used simple font styling so that the user can read easily. Also the contrast between the background and foreground color also meet good accessibility.The website is designed in such a way that the foreground information is never distracted by background.

The website is made by Using semantic HTML. Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded.

### Bugs
   
   - During Website performance in Lighthouse

      - Performance was low due to jpg images format. Bugs were removed by converting all images from jpg format to webp format.
      - Performance was low because all the images were of different sizes. The problem was solved by using Microsoft PowerToys software and resizing all the images.

   - During Website testing on different devices
   
     - The footer in the contact page was in the middle of the page and was detected when testing the website on Ipad air. The problem was solved by adding position as relative and min-height to be 100vh inside the body element.
     - The main image on the Index page was stretched during the testing website on the mobile device. The bug was solved by reducing height and making use of an object-fit cover.
