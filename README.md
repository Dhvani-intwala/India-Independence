### **Accessibility**


For the Best user experience having an accessible website is most important.

Therefore I have used simple font styling so that the user can read easily. Also the contrast between the background and foreground color also meet good accessibility.The website is designed in such a way that the foreground information is never distracted by backgrounds.

Addition of a fixed menu bar so users can easily navigate around the site. The website is made by Using semantic HTML. Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded.
