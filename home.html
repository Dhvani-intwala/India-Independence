            <p>The main aim of Indian Independence movement was to end British rule in India which lasted from 1857 to 1947. Behind the independence of India there was a harsh and disturbing history with many battles and movements which were led by patriotic Indian freedom fighters to free India from British colonialism.</p>

                <h2>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h2>
                <p>The “Father of Nation”, Mahatma Gandhi earned the name because of his great (mahan) deeds like non-violent movements. He married Kasturba when he was 13 and studied law in London before travelling to South Africa to practice law. There, he was inspired to fight for human rights by seeing racial discrimination toward some Indians. Gandhi fervently joined the liberation struggle after seeing how India was being ruled by Englishmen. Freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi led various non-violent protests against the British people in his quest for independence, including the "Dandi March" movement, which he took on his bare foot to remove the salt tax.</p>

                <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h2>
                <p>Also known as the Iron Man of India and Bismarck of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was known for being very brave and epic from a very young age. Initially a lawyer, Sardar Patel left the legal profession to fight for India's independence from British control. Following India's independence, he was appointed as the country's Deputy Prime Minister and worked tirelessly to bring princely states into the Union of India. He also received the honorary Bharat Ratna Award for his hard work and dedication.</p>

                <h2>Bhagat Singh</h2>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was a well-known revolutionary, and a contentious & my personal favourite Freedom Fighter for India who eventually died as a proud martyr for his nation. He was born in Punjab in a Sikh family of independence warriors. Since he was a naturalized citizen, he joined the non-Cooperation movement in 1921. To foster patriotism in Punjabi youth, he founded the "Naujawan Bharat Sabha."
                     The Chauri-Chaura Massacre changed him completely. At the age of 23, he was hung to death by British colonizers. His enduring nickname is "Shaheed (martyr) Bhagat Singh." Freedom fighter Bhagat Singh popularized the term "Inquilab Zindabad", and it eventually became the anthem of the Indian independence struggle.</p>

                <h2>Subhas Chandra Bose</h2>
                <p>Subhas Chandra Bose freedom fighter, known as Netaji, was born in Orissa. He may have been shaken by the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and forced to leave England for India in 1921. He became a member of the Indian National Congress and participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement. 
                    He sought assistance in Germany after becoming dissatisfied with Gandhi Ji's Non-Violence Method of Freedom and finally founded the Azad Hind Government & Azad Hind Army, now known as Indian National Army (INA), where he trained and supervised all freedom fighters.</p>

                <h2>Rani-Lakshmibai</h2>
                <p>On November 19, 1828, the Queen of Jhansi Rani Laxmibai was born in Varanasi. She goes by the stage name Manu and goes by the name Manikarnika Tambe. She was one of the most tenacious soldiers in the Revolutionary War.
                     She inspired numerous Indian women to fight for their country’s freedom, and she still inspires women to defend their rights today. She defended her fortress with her infant child when British troops invaded it in 1858. On June 18, 1858, in Gwalior, she perished in the Battle against a Huge Rose.</p>
